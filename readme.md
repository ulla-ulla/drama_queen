# ðŸŽ­ Drama Queen

**Drama Queen** is a multi-platform drama staging and directing application.  
It helps stage everything â€” from lighting, character placement, and script timing to sound design â€” all inside a 3D environment.

- Import your own 3D stage.
- Add cast members and props.
- Place and animate lights, sounds, and actions on a timeline.
- Export everything as a `.dq` file (`.dramaqueen`).
- Share or view projects online through the Drama Queen Portal.

This is the **first public edition (v0.x)**. Expect bugs, missing features, and plenty of iteration. Contributions are welcome!
